What makes jschess different?
-----------------------------
* Pure javascript.
* No images - totally scalable graphics.
* You can have your board at any size you want (because of scalable graphics).
* As a result of being pure javascript totally controllable programatically.
* Looks best.
* Sits on top of good infrastructure (raphael.js,jQuery.js,prototype.js).
