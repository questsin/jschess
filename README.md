jschess
=======
jschess is a JavaScript chess board written in pure JavaScript. 
It allows yo to create a chess board, have it show games in PGN
notation from a server, moves pieces around, set up positions
and more.

Technologies used
-----------------
* Prototype javascript library (http://prototypejs.org).
* Raphael javascript library (http://raphaeljs.com).

Demo
----
Is at my machine at (http://veltzer.net/jschess).

What makes jschess different?
-----------------------------
* Pure javascript.
* No images - totally scalable graphics.
* You can have your board at any size you want (because of scalable graphics).
* As a result of being pure javascript totally controllable programatically.
* Looks best.
* Sits on top of good infrastructure (prototype.js,raphael.js).

Monetary contribution
