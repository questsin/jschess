add "cleanBoard" method which removes all the pieces and add button to do it.
add code beautifier to the project as third party and show the code that creates
	each example.
add a large scale gallery of the pieces so that I could fine tune the svg of them.
make the pieces move at constant speed (when moving a piece calculate the distance it needs to move
	and the time from the distance/speed, speed should be the parameter at construction at units
	of squares per second).
Make a frame around the board.
	like in the championship: http://moscow2012.fide.com/en/live?g=20120530
Add move control like in the moscow championship.
Add zoom in and zoom out buttons.
Add the moves in a text box to the right.

What about movement of knights? Currently they move in a diagonal which is not very nice visually. Maybe it will be better
	to select one of the ways and move them in two phases (one square up down left or right and one square diagonal) ?
