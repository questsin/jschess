now:
====
- add gradient to the selection (green) fill also.
- add a demo page which shows how to convert a board to a FEN string.
- clear does not clear glowing pieces and selection.
- fix flipping the board:
	- border letters and numbers do not flip when the board flips.
- selecting of pieces:
	- make selecting of squares by click work also when highlighting works.
	- make select by click work on pieces also.
- make the border with color.
- do it so I could get the current version of jschess directly
	from the JavaScript API.
- bring back click on a square.
- do the demos that I know how to do.
	moving pieces + deleting pieces.
	FEN.
	selecting a square.
- pgn parsing.

graphics:
=========
- make each shape zoom out a little before move and zoom back in after move.
- add drag and drop when moving pieces.

mako:
=====

site:
=====
- add a git changelog on my site (with tags).
- make the site carry older versions of jschess too.
- consider changing the name of this project to chess.js.
- add a page showing how to create a full screen chess board.

build system:
=============
- unite the wrapper.py and wrapper_noerr.py scripts.

code:
=====
- disallow flip when the flip has not yet ended (using an event at the end of the animation
	which will re-enable the flip).
- consider moving pieces at certain speeds and having the speed and not the
	time of the animation recorded in the config.
- consider morphing one piece into another using raphael.js animations
	when one shape turns into another (coronations).
- cache SVG elements so that clear/startpos cycles will be faster.
- add a type safe config standalone system.
- add "cleanBoard" method which removes all the pieces and add button to do it.
- add a large scale gallery of the pieces so that I could fine tune the svg of them.
	(link to it from the main jschess page).
- make the pieces move at constant speed (when moving a piece calculate the distance it needs to move
	and the time from the distance/speed, speed should be the parameter at construction at units
	of squares per second).
- have an option to turn animations of movement of pieces off.
- have a dialog that allows the end user to control all visual aspects of the board.
- make a frame around the board.
	like in the championship: http://moscow2012.fide.com/en/live?g=20120530
- add move control like in the moscow championship.
- add zoom in and zoom out buttons.
- add the moves in a text box to the right.
- what about movement of knights? Currently they move in a diagonal which is not very nice visually. Maybe it will be better
	to select one of the ways and move them in two phases (one square up down left or right and one square diagonal) ?

formats:
========
- need to support both PGN and FEN.
