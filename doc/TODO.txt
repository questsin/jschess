when I put the rooks you can see the flicker that puts them on 0,0.
	Find a way to avoid that flicker. Say create them in the right place from the start.
	or maybe have them invisible and only show them when they reach their right place?
make the pieces move at constant speed (when moving a piece calculate the distance it needs to move
	and the time from the distance/speed, speed should be the parameter at construction at units
	of squares per second).
make a "make install" target to setup a site for jschess with demos.
	link to it from the README.md file.
Make a frame around the board.
	like in the championship: http://moscow2012.fide.com/en/live?g=20120530
Add move control like in the moscow championship.
Add zoom in and zoom out buttons.
Add the moves in a text box to the right.
