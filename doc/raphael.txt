the raphael library:
	http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html

- raphael provide a minified version of their library
	but it does not end with a ';' nor with a newline
	which makes catenating it with other libraries
	difficult.
	I added my own newline after in the raphael minified
	version.
	I also added a version number to the file name.

- if you want to download a non minified version of raphael.js
	you can download it directly from Dimitri's github
	branch (raphael.js).
	I also added a version number to the file name (see above).
