jsl is a javascript lint.
Here is how to install it.
Do not download the source code as it is only partial source and does not include the build
system (so there is nothing you can really do with it...)
Clone the repository:
svn co https://javascriptlint.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/javascriptlint/trunk jsl
then go into it.
run "python setup.py build"
That's it. Keep the folder under something like ~/install and use it.

The website for jsl is:
