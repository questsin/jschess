- because you have many files and you want to tag them and search them efficiently.
- because you believe that tagging is a better way to organize many files than
	plain old folders.
- because searching by tags is a LOT better and a LOT cleaner than searching the
	actual files.
- because tagging allows you to put each file in many categories instead of just
	one.
- because you don't need to change any of the tools you are using and you can
	use tagger for any programming language what so ever.
- because you want the relations between tags that tagger offers to do
	tagging quickly.

	outside the file.
