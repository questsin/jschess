should there be relations between tags?
=======================================
Interesting question. There should be.
A tag may imply another tag (sub tag).
For instance: a tag of "orange" is a sub tag of "fruit".
	This means that if I search for fruit I will also find
	all tagged as orange.
	"orange" may also be "somethingyellow"
	So any tag may be a subtag of any number of tags.
Tagger should know how to read realtionships between tags and import them
into the database.

How should files be stored in the tagger database?
==================================================
I thought about putting the inode numbers in the database.
advantages:
- a file could be searched for very quickly without going to it from the root.
disadvantages:
- what about multiple file systems?
- what about moving files around so that their name remains the same but their inode changes.
	This actually happens to a lot of files when you change your hard drive.
resolution:
store file names as names and not as inodes.

What about positions in files?
==============================
I could add another field in TbFileTag of line number and so the tag could also indicate
the exact position in the file...

What about 'databased less' tagger?
===================================
the idea is that tagger will be used much like git. 'tagger init' will create a .tagger
folder where it will automatically put a config file where you can configure tagger.
Under that folder tagger will put all the data about the tags you are using.

This sounds like a good idea and does not require a database at all.
It looks like this will work fine even for moderate/large project.
Think seriously about implementing this.
