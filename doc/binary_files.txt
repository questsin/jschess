This is my thoughts on binary files...

How can binary files be tagged?

If a binary file was created using a C file then I can supply a C snipplet that puts some
meta data inside the binary file in a special section that will enable tagger to get at
the tags.

If the file was created from a file which was tagged then the binary file can be tagged
with the same tags as the file which create the binary files. This requires that tagger
know about the relationship between the two files. This maybe means that tagger should
be integrated with pdmt. Think about this some more...
